Novice version of Cab Booking System as an Android application.

For all beginners, this is perfect repository to start-off with an android application describing Cab Booking System in simple manner. I have integrated many libraires that will give you some extra knowledge about How to Integrate Libraries. I have also used Google's Firebase for authenticating users, storing realtime database and syncing app data in milliseconds. I have added some security features for better conduct of this application. As it is targetting newbies, I have used basic UI design.

I have used Android Studio 3.0 as an IDE.

For testing the application, you have to Register(Sign Up) for both users i.e. Driver and Customer. While registering for new drivers, you have to provide valid mobile number.
